Included here is the code I use to produce plots for the RA1 Analysis.

The Photon/Had/Muon/DiMuon Plot_Producer.py contain the config file which is passed to Btag_8TeV_Plots.py

Btag_8TeV_Plots.py contains both the plot maker and the webpage maker class. See comments in file to see what is going on.
